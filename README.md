eBookr - Java eBook Reader
==========

A Java eBook reader created for my final year project at University. eBookr allows the opening & bookmarking of a number of formats including:
- Epub
- HTML
- PDF
- CBZ

eBookr is simple to use and has a variety of useful features. There are a number of known issues but these aren't expected to be addressed at this time. While eBookr is not a complete eBook reader and does not have the level of support and features as others, it does fulfil its purpose. If you have any questions about eBookr then please get in touch.
